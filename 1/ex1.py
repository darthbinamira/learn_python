# Exercise 1 - let's do some random printing! :D

import random

    print "Hello again!"
elif line_num == 3:

elif line_num == 4:
    print "This is fun."
elif line_num == 5:
    print 'Yay! Printing.'
elif line_num == 6:
    print "I'd much rather you 'not'."
elif line_num == 7:
    print 'I "said" do not touch this.'
